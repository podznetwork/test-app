							(IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service
							Provider (ISP), date and time stamp, referring/exit
							pages, and possibly the number of clicks. These are
							not linked to any information that is personally

						<p>
							When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to
							process your personal information, we will either
							delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is

							the security of any personal information we process.
							However, despite our safeguards and efforts to
