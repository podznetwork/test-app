					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						In some cases we may use cookies to collect personal

						combine it with other information.
					</p>
				</div>
				<h2 className="text-2xl font-medium">What are cookies?</h2>
				<div className="my-4">
					<p>
						Cookies are small data files that are placed on your
						computer or mobile device when you visit a website.
						Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to
						make their websites work, or to work more efficiently,
						as well as to provide reporting information.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Podz
						Network) are called "first-party cookies." Cookies set
						by parties other than the website owner are called
						"third-party cookies." Third-party cookies enable
						third-party features or functionality to be provided on
						or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive
						content, and analytics). The parties that set these
						third-party cookies can recognize your computer both
						when it visits the website in question and also when it
						visits certain other websites.
					</p>
				</div>
				<h2 className="text-2xl font-medium">Why do we use cookies?</h2>
				<div className="my-4">
					<p>
						We use first- and third-party cookies for several
						reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons
						in order for our Website to operate, and we refer to
						these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies.
						Other cookies also enable us to track and target the
						interests of our users to enhance the experience on our
						Online Properties. Third parties serve cookies through
						our Website for advertising, analytics, and other
						purposes.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						Cookies are also used in order to prepare anonymous
						statistics, which aid us in understanding, how a given
						user prefers to use our Website, allowing us to improve
						its structure and contents, without identifying the
						user. The Podz Network Website may also use certain
						Wordpress features, software such as Google Analytics,
						Google Adsense or Google Adwords, Facebook, Twitter,
						Google+ or other social media “like” buttons or plugins,
						which contain cookies.
					</p>
				</div>
				<h2 className="text-2xl font-medium">
					What types of cookies do we use?
				</h2>
				<div className="my-4">
					<p>
						We use two types of cookies – for the user session and
						fixed ones. The former ones are temporary files, which
						remain on the device of the User until the end of
						his/her user session or until closing the web browser.
						The fixed files remain on the device of the User for the
						period, specified in the cookies themselves or until
						deleted by the User.
					</p>
				</div>
				<h2 className="text-2xl font-medium">
					How can I control cookies?
				</h2>
				<div className="my-4">
					<p>
						You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject
						cookies. You can exercise your cookie rights by setting
						your preferences in the Cookie Consent Manager. The
						Cookie Consent Manager allows you to select which
						categories of cookies you accept or reject. Essential
						cookies cannot be rejected as they are strictly
						necessary to provide you with services.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						The Cookie Consent Manager can be found in the
						notification banner and on our website. If you choose to
						reject cookies, you may still use our website though
						your access to some functionality and areas of our
						website may be restricted. You may also set or amend
						your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies.
					</p>
				</div>
				<h2 className="text-2xl font-medium">
					Do cookies contain personal data?
				</h2>
				<div className="my-4">
					<p>
						On their own, cookies do not require personal
						information in order to be used and most often, they do
						not identify internet Users. The personal data collected
						during the usage of cookies can only be gathered in
						order to ease the use of the services by the User. This
						data is encrypted in such a way that it does not allow
						unauthorized persons to gain access to it.
					</p>
				</div>
				<h2 className="text-2xl font-medium">Deleting the cookies</h2>
				<div className="my-4">
					<p>
						In general, applications for access to web pages (web-
						or mobile browsers) allow the storage of cookies by
						default. These settings may be changed in such a way
						that the automatic administration of cookies is blocked
						by the web browser or that the User would be informed
						each time when cookies are sent to his/her device.
						Detailed information about the options and management of
						cookies may be found in the settings of the Web Browser.
						Limiting the usage of cookies may affect some of the
						features of the Website.

					Security and confidentiality
				</h2>
				<div className="my-4">
					<p>
						Cookies are NOT viruses. They take the form of simple
						text. They are not made out of code and cannot therefore
						be executed or execute themselves alone. Consequently,
						they may not be duplicated or copied into other networks
						in order to get started and copied once more. Since
						cookies cannot perform those functions, they cannot be
						regarded as viruses.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						Most often, browsers have built-in privacy settings,
						which provide different levels for the acceptance of
						cookies, the period of their validity and their
						automatic deletion after a User has visited a given
						website.

					Advice on secure and responsible surfing, using cookies
				</h2>
				<div className="my-4">
					<p>
						Thanks to their flexibility and the fact that many of
						the most visited and biggest websites use cookies, their
						use is almost inevitable. Deactivating cookies will not
						allow the access of a given user to many of the most
						commonly used websites, including YouTube, Yahoo, Gmail
						and others.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						Here is some advice, which can ensure safe surfing, but
						with the help of cookies:
					</p>
					<ul className="list-disc list-inside my-2 ml-8">
						<li className="mb-4">
							Personalize your cookie browser settings, in order
							to create an adequate level of protection from the
							use of cookies.
						</li>
						<li className="mb-4">
							If you are the only person who uses the computer,
							you may set longer terms for expiration of the
							storage of the browsing history and access to
							personal data.
						</li>
						<li className="mb-4">
							If you share your computer access with somebody, you
							may set your browser settings to delete the surfing
							data every time you close your web browser.
						</li>
						<li className="mb-4">
							Ensure that your browser is always up to date. Many
							of the attacks, based on cookies, are realized when
							exploiting the weak spots of old and non-updated
							versions of the web browsers. Cookies are everywhere
							and they may not be circumvented if you would like
							to enjoy your access to the best and biggest
							websites on the Internet.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						It is possible that you set your browser in a way that
						does not allow for cookies to be accepted anymore or you
						can set your browser to accept cookies only from certain
						websites. All modern browsers offer the option to change
						cookie settings. This includes computer browsers, as
						well as mobile device browsers. These settings can be
						found in the "options" menu or the "preferences" menu of
						your browser.
					</p>
				</div>
				<h2 className="text-2xl font-medium">Contact us</h2>
